# Sunbird Web extensions

Sunbird web extension would allow you to write application as composition of pluggable modules and provide additional functionality through it. It helps you manage the scope of your application/project.

Sometimes, a requested feature is really nice and helpful, but it would bloat the application core when its design is not handled carefully. Instead of snowballing your whole application or library with such features, design your whole application in a way that it allows you to build a plugin architecture that has a great effect on the extensibility of your system.

A pluggable framework (or plug-in architecture) means a system which allows third party developers to create or extend the functionality of a primary application through the use of pluggable components without having direct access to or knowledge of the primary application's source code or inner workings.

This is because you're making your application open for extensibility but closing it for modification. This will allow us to develop portable functionality that is packaged into plugins.

## 1. Design Overview:

The system that we're going to build in this chapter borrows a lot of mechanisms that are already present in the Angular framework. In order to implement extensibility using plugins, we rely on the following core concepts:

<li>We use directives to indicate extension points in the UI, which we call plugin extension points. These plugin extension point directives will be responsible for the dynamic instantiation of plugin components and will insert them into the application UI at the given position</li>

<li>Plugins expose components using a concept that we call plugin placements. Plugin placements declare what components of a plugin should be placed into which plugin extension points in the application. We also use plugin placements to decide the order in which components from different plugins should be inserted into the plugin extension points. For this, we'll use a property called priority.</li>

<li>We use the dependency injection of Angular to provide the instantiated plugin information into the plugin components. As the plugin components will be placed in a spot where there's already an injector present, they will be able to inject surrounding components and dependencies in order to connect to the application.</li>


## 2. Setup:

Clone the repo and run the following commands:

1. `cd web-extensions/sunbird-web-extensions-app`
2. `npm install`
3. `ng build sunbird-web-extension`  // to build library dist
4. `ng serve`

## 3. Getting started with Angular:

**Prerequisites:**

we assume that you have at least some basic knowledge of Angular-CLI, TypeScript, a reasonable familiarity with Node and how all of these fit together and also you already have an angular application up and running.

If you don't have angular application running, continue to follow the steps below:

Angular in it's latest version(Angular 6.0), many of the improvements were to the Angular CLI and a new schematic has been added to help you generate a library.

Let us begin by setting up the workspace.

1. **Creating an Angular Workspace:**

Our first goal was to create an Angular workspace named `my-app`

```console
 ng new my-app
 cd my-app
 ng serve --open
```
When we point our browser at: `http://localhost:4200/` we see the starter Angular application

> NOTE: If you don't have Angular-CLI, follow the below steps:
>
> 1. Install the Angular CLI, if you haven't already done so.
> 2. To quickly set up Node.js on your machine, [Set up Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
> 3. To learn more about Angular 6 and it's features, head to [Angular 6 docs](https://angular.io/docs)


2. **Creating a library with Angular 6 and above:**

To generate a library in Angular-CLI just run the following command.

```console
 ng generate library library-name
```

and it will scaffold the necessary files in the projects directory.

The important thing is that you can directly import from the library into your applications in the same CLI project, even without publishing the library on NPM.

For example, letâ€™s say you generated a `shared` library. By default the CLI will produce a `shared` directory inside projects, with a `ShareComponent` and a `SharedService`. 

If you want to use the SharedService inside your application, for example in app.component.ts, you simply have to import:

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
import { SharedService } from 'shared'; 

 @Component({ 
  selector: 'app-root', 
  templateUrl: './app.component.html', 
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] 
 }) 
 export class AppComponent { 
  title = 'app'; 

  constructor(sharedService: SharedService) { 
 // note the import at the top! 
  } 
 } 
```

And the CLI will handle it!

This opens great possibilities for large project, and for developers to open source libraries of useful components and services!

Obviously, these developers will not be familiar with all of the intricacies of the code for the application they are plugging into. Once the plugins are developed, other even less technical users may simply install the application and any selected plugins.


## 4. Tutorials:

### 4.1 Build your first plugin:

Before we get into the plugin details, we should first agree on where to make our application extensible. Our plugin system is based on the ExtensionPoint directives, which should be placed somewhere in our component tree so that plugins can expose components to these extension points.

For now, we decide to make one menu items at the top in our application extensible:

Table Generator: A menu item that takes the user to generate a table in their content editor.
Firstly, lets set the plugin placement by setting out `ExtensionPoint` directive into your `app.component.ts` which is going to load our top menu.

```HTML
    <extension-point name="table-generator"></extension-point>
```

Let's start building this Table Generator plugin/library using the following CLI command.

```console
ng generate library table-generator
```
It creates all the necessary files.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LpTsBGk.png)

The files are create at a location based on the path mentioned in the `angular.json` file.

Here the path mentioned is `my-app/projects`

We have now created `TableGeneratorComponent` that we want to expose.

```javascript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; 
  @Component({ 
   selector: 'lib-table-generator', 
   template: ` 
    <p> table-generator works!</p> 
   `, 
    styles: [] 
  }) 
  export class TableGeneratorComponent implements OnInit { 
   constructor() { } 
   ngOnInit() { } 
 }
```

You can see that we implemented a regular component here. There's nothing special about this component at all.

Create `plugin.ts` file inside `table-generator/src/lib`

![](https://i.imgur.com/EInPHiN.png)

This `plugin.ts` will contain the plugin configuration.

Alright, now we can import the `sunbird-web-extension` module and also can expose the plugin component in the plugin configuration using a `PluginPlacement` object. Let's make the necessary modification to our `plugin.ts` module file:

```javascript
import { PluginConfig, PluginPlacement } from 'sunbird-web-extension'; 
import { TableGeneratorComponent } from '../public_api'; 

@PluginConfig({ 
 name: 'table generator plugin', 
 description: 'TableGenerator', 
 placements: [ 
 ] 
}) 
export class TableGeneratorPlugin { 
}
```

Now, we include a new `PluginPlacement` object in our plugin configuration, which maps our `TableGenerator` component to be exposed into the application extension point with the name `table-generator`:

```javascript
import { PluginConfig, PluginPlacement } from 'sunbird-web-extension'; 
import { TableGeneratorComponent } from '../public_api'; 

@PluginConfig({ 
 name: 'table generator plugin', 
 description: 'TableGenerator', 
 placements: [ 
 new PluginPlacement({name: 'table-generator', priority: 1, component: TableGeneratorComponent})

 ] 
}) 
export class TableGeneratorPlugin { 
} 
```

Let us create an `index.ts` and export the plugin's module, component and the plugin configurations.

```javascript
 export * from './src/lib/plugin'; 
 export * from './src/lib/table-generator.module'; 
 export * from './src/lib/table-generator.component';
```

This would already be enough for the plugin to work.

The only thing that is left is to add the plugin to the list of plugins that should be loaded initially by the `PluginService` directive.

### 4.2 Integrating plugin with app:

1. To integrate the plugin that we just built into the Sunbird Platform we'll create a framework.config.ts file on the root of our application and add the following content:

```javascript
export const WebExtensionsConfig = { 
  plugins: [ 
  { 
   'id': 'table-generator', 
   'ver': '1.0.0', 
   'module': TableGeneratorModule, 
   'main': TableGeneratorPlugin 
  }] 
 };
```
Next, we will import the build of `sunbird-web-extension` module and `framework.config.ts` into your main `app.module.ts`

```javascript
import { BootstrapFramework, WebFrameworkModule } from '../../libs/sunbird-web-extension'; 
import { WebExtensionsConfig } from '../framework.config';  
```

This will import `BootstrapFramework` and `WebFrameworkModule` classes. and the config file which has the array of plugins that we want to extend on the fly.

Now, if we launch our application, the plugin will be loaded by the `PluginService` and `ExtensionPoint` directives will instantiate the `TableGenerator` plugin components where appropriate.


2. Next, create a file called `framework.config.ts` file under the `src/` folder of your angular app

```text
your-angular-app-folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ libs/
     â”œâ”€â”€sunbird-web-extension
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
        ...
     â”œâ”€â”€framework.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ angular.json
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

**Summarizing on our first plugin:**

Well done! You have successfully implemented your first plugin! In this section, we used the API of our plugin architecture to create a plugin to manage Table Generation. We used the `PluginPlacement` class to map our plugin components to different slots in the UI of our application. We also made use of the `PluginData` object that is provided to each instantiated component in the plugin slot in order to access the plugin instance. The advantage of implementing functionality like this inside a plugin should be obvious. We added an additional feature to our application without building up additional dependencies. Our Table Generator feature is completely portable. Third-party developers can write independent plugins, and they can be loaded by our system. This is a big advantage, and it helps us keep our core slim while providing great extensibility.

### 4.3 Sample plugin demo:

[Click here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-5wiszx?embed=1&file=src/app/sample-plugin/sample-plugin.component.ts&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1&view=preview)


> NOTE: Dynamic loading of plugin during runtime is not supported!
>
> Here in the demo, Plugin is loaded dynamically for demo purpose only.

## 5. API document:

### 1. `extension-point` Angular directive:

This directive will allow other extensions to extend the app functionality. Plugin can also use this directive inside there components to allow other plugin to extend and so on. 

Options:

|Attribute|Description|
|---|----|
|1. `name`: <i>String</i>| name of the extension point, to be namespaced, to avoid global namespace collision.  e.g: `com.sunbird.myplugin` for sunbird extensions |
|2. `override`: <i>Boolean</i>| if `true`, it will allow multiple extensions on the same extension point, if `false`, it will allow only one extension (based on hihest priority set in `PluginPlacement`) |
|3. input: <i>any</i> | to bind data to extension during initialisation |
|4. output: <i>EventEmitter</i> | to bind output events from extensions |


### 2. `PluginConfig ` Annotation:

```javascript
@PluginConfig({
    name: String,
    description: String,
    placements: Array<PluginPlacement>
})
export class MyPlugin {
}
```
`PluginConfig` annotation decorates `MyPlugin`(in example) class with details such as name, description, placements of the extension which is required for the framework to place the extension based on the placements info provided.


### 3. `PluginPlacement` Class:

`PluginPlacement` has detail about the angular component which has to be rendered at defined host `extension-point`.

|Member| Description |  
|----|----|
| 1. `name`: <i>String</i>| name of the host `extension-point` |
| 2. `priority`: <i>number</i> (non-negative)| can be any valid poisitve Integer, priority 1 is considered as highest priority |
| 3. `component`: <i>Component\<T></i> | Token/class of angular component |

`priority`: if a `extension-point` is extended by more than one extension, then framework resolves which extension to allowed based on this feild. 

Example:
Say, we have `extension-point` as below:

```javascript
<extension-point name="com.subird.profile.widget" override=true>
```
this extension would allow only extension to extended, since `override` flag is set to `true`.

for instance, there are 2 plugins (A, B) would like to extend the same extension-point, in this case it check for priority. Say A has priority 1 and B has priority 4, in this case framework picks the A plugin to extend the host extension-point.

If A and B has same priority, say 1 (which is not desirable), in this case framework picks up the plugin randomly.
